slug: proof-of-concept
order: 2
pillar: poc
hook: You need to know if it works before committing to production.
tagline: Prove feasibility quickly with rapid prototyping, model experimentation, and first working AI workflows.
bestFor: Teams that have validated a use case and need a working prototype to de-risk the build path.
outcome: A working prototype and a clear path to production.

Prove feasibility quickly before scaling. I focus on rapid prototyping, model and pipeline experimentation, and first working AI workflows with performance and cost benchmarks so you get a working prototype and a clear path to production.
