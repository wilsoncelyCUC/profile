Task
Make a single UI component following these guidelines:

Create the component file in src/components/ui/

Use a functional component with the name in PascalCase

Variants
Add the following variants for the component using the colours from the theme variables in the @src\app\globals.css file:

primary

secondary

success

danger

warning

Support common patterns like disabled states and sizes where appropriate (sm, md, lg, defaulting to md when no preference is passed).

Testing
Make a test file for the component to test basic use cases

Use @src\components\ui\Button\Button.test.tsx as a reference to make the test file for the new component.

Run tests and iterate until they all pass.

Previews
Add the component to the src/app/preview/page.tsx file so it can be viewed in the browser, and use multiple variants.

Do NOT add the component to any other page.
